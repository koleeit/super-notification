# Super Notification

Super Notification has a powerful notification UX.
No one will miss the notification.

Are my colleagues or business partners not responding to my messages? I think they might not be checking their notifications because they're using two or three monitors.

I've created a simple notification application that they simply must respond to.

Additionally, there's a feature planned for you if you keep forgetting tasks.
